## Candy Store Progress üç¨
Since last week, our team has made important progress on the candy store:
1. We finally assembled the final draft of the central tree mechanism during last wednesday's class. Our centerpiece is almost ready, all we need to do is to laser cut the bigger tree (which we will do next week) and begin to decorate.
      Based on some testing, we also want to alter the design of the tree a bit. Aigerim created a Procreate sketch with more curved edges and less branches so that (a) we can add more hanging lollypops, and (b) the tree looks less like a halloween tree.
2. We also assembled the bunny rising mechanism. Next step, build the bunnies & the hats. For this, we spent some time outside of class (see following two points).
3. It took us a little bit of time, back and forth, but Jackie got us access to the mixed media studio. In the upcoming two days we will go there to (1) paint and stain the wood from the railings and structure, and (2) craft the bunnies.
4. We also acquired some scraps from Professor Khulood's plastic lab in order to build the hats, from which the bunnies will rise. 
5. For the neon signs, Juanma finalized the designs and spent a long time with Dania trying to laser cut and engrave them. We have successfully completed one sign, but are struggling to cut the other two... However, the engraving looks beautifulf. Huge thanks to Dania for helping us so so so much with the laser cutter handling, and for spending all that extra time problem solving.
6. We have also researched and understood the adafruit for the music box.

**Next Steps:**
- Build the candy store structure. We need to make sure our assemblies fit well, and make any required changes.
- Fix the laser cut signs and build the LED base.
- Construct the music box. This will be the final core mechanism of our candy store. When it (and the signs) are done, we will focus on decorating. Other mechanisms are in the nice-to-haves.
- Design the bunnies a hat.
