# Getting Started! ðŸ”Ž

We were very excited to get started with our candy shop. The first thing we did was measure the module Nelson built for us.
For anyone wondering it is 80cmx64cm. 
We began designing a precise layout for our shop, as we want to have two floors, and figuring out the structure is a natural first step.

Jackie designed an amazing railing which we cut using the laser cutter from the Scene Shop. (Jackie works there) This gave us a good headstart in the construction. We aim to have the floors and railings complete sooner rather than later. This will allow us to have a structure to which we can add our mechanisms + decorations later. We believe this will be easier than doing it the other way around. We discussed quite a bit where will we position our cables, and what mechanisms do we want to run when.

Furthermore, we also began working on our **centerpiece**. This might not be the most challenging per se, but the largest and most important. We want to make sure it is perfect in our final product! We could not find the Lazy Susan on friday, so we attached a stepper motor to a makeshift base using blue tack. Even though we do not plan to keep this AT ALL, we wanted to connect the stepper motor to a tree, and figure out **the dynamics of controlling it.** It ended up working quite well. We designed a cardboard tree, and wrote the code in Arduino so that we can control the spinning (turn it on and off).

As Aigerim mentions in the video, we realized we did not really know how to control a stepper motor. The first step in our next progress report is to fix this so we can control the rotation as we please. The second step is to add the Lazy Susan. We will larger pieces of wood than the one pictured, they will be round, and we will attach them using screws. We could not meet over the weekend, but plan to do this very soon. 

Some challenges that we are concerned about (not concerned concerned, but want to keep in mind):
1. The stepper motor has a very visible clock-wise moition. Are we ok with this, or do we want to use a continous servo/another motor? Will it look different once we implement the lazy susan?
2. Will we be able to place cables underneath the "floor", or should we build a platform under which we place the motor of the tree and the board?
3. We now underdtand why a lazy susan is immportant! Even though our tree spun (I dare to say beautofully), it is very difficult to mantain it balanced while only beeing held up by the motor. A question is, will the lazy susan be sufficient to address this?
4. BIG LESSON: Just because a mechanism work, it does not mean it will work later. Durability is something that we should consider with greater care.
