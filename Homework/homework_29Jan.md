## Clock Themes
1. Theme Park: Imagine a clock with a mini roller coaster, figures screaming in fear, swings of death, and slow rivers. We will make our audience wish they could attend the MachineLab Land Park! ðŸŽ¢
2. Mini IM Showcase: This clock's theme will be an ode to our journeys in the IM department. Each team would chose a project they worked on during their time here and make it the theme of their part. This would make a mini IM showcase within the IM showcase!! ðŸ¤–
3. MachineLab Cafe: What if we all owned a cafe together. The clock would be the center piece of our cafe and each piece would correspond to a step in the coffee value chain. (i.e coffee farmers picking the beans, roasting, shipping). Maybe even one part could pour actual cold brew coffee. ðŸ§‹ 
## Research Ideas
1. Watter Cutter: https://electricalworkbook.com/water-jet-machining/ I've heard there is a water jet cutter on campus and I am incredibly interested in finding pout how it works, and what are its uses. Water seems quite inoffensive to me, and studying this machine will certainly break this assumption. One question I have, is if it can be applied for any liquid... imagine a coffee cutter machine! In short, water cutters use water at high pressures to use precision cutting. This could be a valuable tool for cutting certain materials for our class.
2. Roller Coasters: https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/physics/item/why-dont-i-fall-out-when-a-roller-coaster-goes-upside-down/#:~:text=A%20roller%20coaster%20does%20not,train%20is%20pulled%20by%20gravity. I've always been so fascinated with roller coasters. Why do they work and why are they so safe? Understanding the rail mechanisims, the pulleys, and the lack of an engine to generate energy will certainly be an interesting research topic. Especially if we are building a theme park clock.
3. Metal Casting: https://www.generalkinematics.com/blog/metal-casting-process-explained/#:~:text=In%20the%20metal%20casting%20process,influential%20industrial%20process%20in%20history. Metal has always seem very study and durable. How is it that we are able to manipulate it so easily? Researching about metal casting, pouring molten metal into a cast in order to shape it, will be valuable in understanding how to build certain pieces of machines. Perhaps it won't be viable for our clock, but certainly to understand how some pieces we use are made.
4. Fountains: https://science.howstuffworks.com/engineering/structural/question33.htm Working with water seems hard. I remember watching Kyle Adam's capstone (https://www.kyleadams.com/page/bio) and being amazed by it. When researching about fountains I found out that some of them work without a motor pump. How can water be manipulated through gravity? and what does one need to take care of when implementing a fountain in a machine? into a clock?
5. Robots that build Stuff: I constantly wonder how our phones are made. What machines are in charge of making the pieces? https://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/11/13/bloomberg-details-apples-sophisticated-manufacturing-robots-and-equipment/ Researching about this will also help us understand how some pieces and materials we use work, and how steps we take for our clock are taken at an industrial and commercial level.
