## The Tree 
- We set up and figured out the code for the DC motor. We decided to add the potentiometer & button to control the speed & direction of the tree. We believe that playing around with these parameters will help our store feel much more alive. What if it moves faster at :00's and a bit slower at :30's!

- We designed the tree in procreate & traced it in illustratot. We went through A LOT of iterations as it looked too scary, or too crowded for the lollypops to hang. We then explored
