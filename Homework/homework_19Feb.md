# Candy Store Progress üç≠
We made a lot of progress since last wednesday! Throughout the end of last week we worked on the three different elements requested for our homework. We also made some progress on on the desired set up. See more details below!

## The Tree 
- We set up and figured out the code for the DC motor. We decided to add the potentiometer & button to control the speed & direction of the tree. We believe that playing around with these parameters will help our store feel much more alive. What if it moves faster at :00's and a bit slower at :30's! OR, what if it moves as per the music's tempo? üéº

- For our prototype, we cut a piece of wood with an 8mm hole. It fit very well with the motor, and made us wonder if we should use the lazy susan. Our motive for using it is the weight & size of the tree. So, instead of guessing, we began to build it.
- We went through a lot of iterations of tree design, and what we want it to look like. It was a very important step for us because the tree is going to be a centerpiece. I (Aigerim) tried out different styles and as a team, we picked the one we liked the most and worked on perfecting it.

- With the corrected illustrator files, and functioning DC Motors, we built a second, more precise prototype for the tree. We are wondering if the size is good, or if we should make it larger. Furthermore, we still do not have an accurate representation of the weight. Juanma thought laser cutting wood was less heavy, so upcoming updates on that.

- Immediate Next Steps: Update our prototype by implementing the lazy susan + Understanding the size and weight of the tree.

## NeoPixels
- We started working with the neopixels. The biggest challenge was (and still is) soldering the wires into the neopixel strip. We ran a test code and figured out how to control each neopixel‚Äôs color (see video below), but at the end of testing, one of the wires fell off üò≠. The questions/challenges/next steps to figure out are:
- How to ensure that the soldering of wires onto the neo pixels stays secure?
- The Arduino board started heating up a lot during testing (hot to the touch), is this an issue with the board? How do I prevent this from happening?


## More Movement
- We believe the hat with the bunny, the flashing signs, the music box, and the gumball machine will be enough movement. Is there any recommendation from the class regarding our module?
