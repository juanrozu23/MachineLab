# Machine Lab Final Project: Theme Park üé™ / Fair

#### Team: Aigerim, Jackie, Sunny, Juanma

Building a theme park clock would allow us to play with vibrant colors, lights, and creative mechanisms. Each of the projects within the clock would be an attraction/shop of the clock, which could run every 15 min, 30 min or every hour. At 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00 all of them could go at the same time following the ‚Äúmagic kingdom fireworks‚Äù tradition. This theme will further allow each group to work on their attraction with a theme of their own: Star Wars carousel, Pirates of the Caribbean swing boat ride, Avatar dump bucket, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory candy store‚Ä¶ The possibilities are endless. 

### Our team has come up with five possible projects that the teams in the class could do within our proposed theme.
- [Ferris wheel:](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1014716165/miniature-handmade-toy-ferris-wheel) centered around one giant wheel, but with all sorts of noises and small interactions to add motion and intrigue.
- [Candy Store:](https://blog.discoveruniversal.com/dining/candy-shops-universal-orlando/) a playful, willy wonka style store with playful characters and candy wheels.
- Carousel: As discussed in class.
- Swing Boat Ride: a large dragon boat style contraption that hinges at the top. Either a mechanism lifts one end up and releases it, or the motor continuously swings in a small range of motion.
- Dump Bucket/ Fountain: Some of the ideas on discord mention wanting to work with water! This could be a good way to explore it within our proposed theme. 


### The project we would like to work on is the candy store.
- **What would it depict?**
Looking into this stand is like being teleported into a magical and chaotic wonderland. Childlike and colorful, this maximalist booth features the most essential, mouth-watering candies crafted in the most inviting colors and textures. While the foreground features a centerpiece that spins slowly and several smaller animated pieces, A staircase also leads up to a higher level with smaller detail and light-up parts.
- **What materials will you use for each part?**
Since the piece relies heavily on color, the main material will be painted luan- sturdy enough to support small motors, but light enough to easily accommodate details like staircases and pillars.
The main figures, including a central tree, are made from papier mache. This allows for flexibility with textures and unique shapes, while being as light as a feather - light enough to spin on a motor reliably for up to a year.
For smaller details and candies, air dry clay and craft materials like cotton balls or foil will add interesting textures that draw more visual interest to individual candies.
For certain machines, we can have real candies for the users, adding a heavily interactive component to our project. 

- **How would you animate anything moving?**
1. A lollipop tree that spins slowly, offering candy to nearby visitors- easily operated by a servo motor hidden under the floor.
2. A bunny slowly popping out of a hat and slipping back down into the hat. Using a servo motor to operate a platform that moves up and down in a small range of motion, pushing the bunny.
3. A gumball machine that has real candies inside. Activated with tokens (that will be distributed to everyone), the machine releases one candy for each token entered.
4. A music box.
5. A light-up sign made of strips of lights that indicate new candies.

- **Will there be sound? What?**
A theme park is naturally full of sounds. The candy store could be full of sharp noises like bells that resemble cash registers and doors opening. The mechanical noises of motors are nostalgic and reminiscent of theme park rides, and we might lean into the noises created by the small motors.
If possible, we could put in a wind up music box that plays songs like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq5lHblFTkI)
Depending if we use a speaker or a music box, we can have different carnival/candy themed songs play for different sections. 
Some [other sound effects](https://freesound.org/people/tyops/packs/14115/) we looked at.

- **Will there be lights?**
For the candy store, the lights will be mostly on the second floor, made into strips that indicate certain foods or products in an inviting way.Lights are very important for a [theme park](), and we would like to use neon-looking lights whenever any of our modules are running.

- **What mechanical components will you need?**
Servo Motors to make Lazy Susan, neopixel lights, arduino boards.

- **What electronic components will you need?**
LEDs, speakers for the sound, arduino
Neopixels - make the shop sign

- **What tools or equipment or skills will you need?**
Crafting skills and materials, such as papier mache
Paint
Laser cutting and simple woodworking skills for the staircase and second floor -- Can we use the wood workshop?
[Turning cotton balls into cotton candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA)
Cardboard, plastic sheets, colored paper

- **Mood Board & Inspiration**
We can have a candy tree that spins and has a LOT of lollipops/cotton candy/color in it
The name can be something that resembles Willy Wonka, and we use the same font for the shop name
Another inspiration could be Weasleys‚Äô Wizard Wheezes in Universal studios from the HP movies. It‚Äôs got a mechanical entry and little machines inside to create a lot of visual chaos!
It would be very cool if we can imitate melting chocolate/chocolate fountain

# Research Presentation Ideas
1. In the spirit of my team's proposed theme, I would love to research LaMarcus Thompson, inventor of the rollercoaster. 
2. I am a big coffee fan, and would love to research the espresso machine. I am very interested in finding out how the pressure is produced, and in exploring the recent trend of machines without electricity/ handheld espresso machines.
