# Machine Lab Final Project: Theme Park üé™ / Fair

### Team: Aigerim, Jackie, Sunny, Juanma

Building a theme park clock would allow us to play with vibrant colors, lights, and creative mechanisms. Each of the projects within the clock would be an attraction/shop of the clock, which could run every 15 min, 30 min or every hour. At 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00 all of them could go at the same time following the ‚Äúmagic kingdom fireworks‚Äù tradition. This theme will further allow each group to work on their attraction with a theme of their own: Star Wars carousel, Pirates of the Caribbean swing boat ride, Avatar dump bucket, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory candy store‚Ä¶ The possibilities are endless. 

### Our team has come up with five possible projects that the teams in the class could do within our proposed theme.
- Ferris wheel: centered around one giant wheel, but with all sorts of noises and small interactions to add motion and intrigue.
Candy Store: a playful, willy wonka style store with playful characters and candy wheels.
- Carousel: As discussed in class.
- Swing Boat Ride: a large dragon boat style contraption that hinges at the top. Either a mechanism lifts one end up and releases it, or the motor continuously swings in a small range of motion.
- Dump Bucket/ Fountain: Some of the ideas on discord mention wanting to work with water! This could be a good way to explore it within our proposed theme. 


### The project we would like to work on is the candy store.
